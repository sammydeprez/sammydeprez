Hello! I'm Sammy, a seasoned consultant with a passion for all things AI and Microsoft Stack. My journey began over a decade ago in the diverse fields of finance and healthcare, where I honed my skills and delivered impactful projects. In 2015, I took a leap into the world of Machine Learning and AI, driven by the belief in their transformative power. This led me to co-found a company in 2017 that specializes in leveraging AI and Microsoft tools to unlock organizational potential.

But life isn't all about work! I'm originally from Belgium, but I've found a second home in Nairobi, Kenya, surrounded by the warmth and vibrancy of its people. I'm a family man, happily married with two wonderful kids who keep me on my toes. When I'm not immersed in AI, you'll find me indulging in my childhood passion for LEGO, building and creating with my little ones.

I believe in the power of AI to change the world, and I'm dedicated to sharing this vision. Whether it's speaking at international conferences or contributing to the global AI community, I'm always eager to inspire others on their AI journey. Let's build a smarter future together!
